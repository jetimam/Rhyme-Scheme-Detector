-pip install PyPDF2

Text can be inputted inside the text box, and then depending on what the user wishes to do with the said input, either the Rhyme Scheme
Detector or the Rhyme Dictionary can be run. 

For sentences, using the detector will sort all the words in a way that all the words
that rhyme will be categorized together.

For a word, using the dictionary will give many other words that rhyme with the inputted word.

The 'Open PDF' function serves as a way of extracting content from a PDF document and into the input box.
